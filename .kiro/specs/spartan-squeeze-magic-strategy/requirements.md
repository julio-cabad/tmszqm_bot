# Requirements Document - Spartan Squeeze Magic Strategy

## Introduction

The Spartan Squeeze Magic Strategy is a professional multi-cryptocurrency trading system that combines the Squeeze Momentum Indicator (LazyBear) with the Trend Magic Indicator to create high-probability trading signals. The system monitors multiple cryptocurrency pairs simultaneously to maximize trading opportunities, designed for timeframes of 30 minutes and above, focusing on quality over quantity with comprehensive configurability for all parameters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configurable Trading Strategy Engine

**User Story:** As a professional trader, I want a fully configurable trading strategy engine, so that I can optimize parameters for different market conditions and timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure Trend Magic parameters THEN the system SHALL allow modification of CCI period, ATR multiplier, and ATR period
2. WHEN I configure Squeeze Momentum parameters THEN the system SHALL allow modification of BB length, BB multiplier, KC length, and KC multiplier
3. WHEN I configure timeframes THEN the system SHALL support multiple timeframes (15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
4. WHEN I save configuration THEN the system SHALL persist settings in a configuration file
5. WHEN I load configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all parameters and provide error messages for invalid values

### Requirement 2: Multi-Timeframe Analysis System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want multi-timeframe analysis capabilities, so that I can analyze market context and make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze multiple timeframes THEN the system SHALL provide context from higher timeframes (4h, 1d)
2. WHEN I request signal analysis THEN the system SHALL analyze primary timeframe (30m, 1h) for entry signals
3. WHEN I need confirmation THEN the system SHALL provide lower timeframe (15m, 30m) confirmation
4. WHEN timeframes conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize higher timeframe context
5. WHEN I switch timeframes THEN the system SHALL recalculate all indicators for the new timeframe

### Requirement 3: Signal Generation and Classification

**User Story:** As a trader, I want automated signal generation with clear classification, so that I can identify high-probability trading opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Squeeze is ON and Trend Magic is BLUE and Momentum is GREEN THEN the system SHALL generate SUPER_BULLISH signal
2. WHEN Squeeze is ON and Trend Magic is RED and Momentum is RED THEN the system SHALL generate SUPER_BEARISH signal
3. WHEN Squeeze changes from ON to OFF THEN the system SHALL generate BREAKOUT signal with direction
4. WHEN Trend Magic changes color THEN the system SHALL generate TREND_CHANGE signal
5. WHEN indicators conflict THEN the system SHALL generate NO_SIGNAL and wait for alignment
6. WHEN signal strength is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide probability score (0-100%)

### Requirement 4: Multi-Cryptocurrency Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time monitoring of multiple cryptocurrency pairs with customizable alerts, so that I can maximize trading opportunities across different markets without constantly watching multiple screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring multiple cryptocurrencies THEN the system SHALL track 20+ configured trading pairs simultaneously
2. WHEN a high-probability signal occurs on any pair THEN the system SHALL send audio alert with signal type and symbol
3. WHEN I configure alert preferences THEN the system SHALL allow customization of sound files and alert types per symbol
4. WHEN system detects signal THEN the system SHALL log timestamp, symbol, signal type, and probability score
5. WHEN I request current status THEN the system SHALL display real-time indicator values for all monitored symbols
6. WHEN I add/remove symbols THEN the system SHALL dynamically update monitoring without restart

### Requirement 5: Risk Management Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want integrated risk management tools, so that I can manage position sizing and stop losses effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I calculate position size THEN the system SHALL use configurable risk percentage of account balance
2. WHEN I set stop loss THEN the system SHALL calculate stop based on Trend Magic line position
3. WHEN I set take profit THEN the system SHALL provide multiple TP levels based on momentum changes
4. WHEN Trend Magic changes color THEN the system SHALL suggest position exit
5. WHEN risk parameters are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate warning alerts

### Requirement 6: Historical Analysis and Backtesting

**User Story:** As a trader, I want historical analysis capabilities, so that I can validate strategy performance and optimize parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run backtest THEN the system SHALL analyze historical data for specified date range
2. WHEN backtest completes THEN the system SHALL provide win rate, average R:R, and profit statistics
3. WHEN I optimize parameters THEN the system SHALL test multiple parameter combinations
4. WHEN I analyze signals THEN the system SHALL show historical signal accuracy and performance
5. WHEN I export results THEN the system SHALL save backtest data in CSV format

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a robust configuration management system, so that I can save, load, and share different strategy configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create configuration THEN the system SHALL save all parameters in JSON format
2. WHEN I load configuration THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and apply settings
3. WHEN I export configuration THEN the system SHALL create shareable configuration file
4. WHEN I import configuration THEN the system SHALL merge settings with current configuration
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and use defaults

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive performance monitoring, so that I can track system performance and trading results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system runs THEN the system SHALL log all signals with timestamps and parameters
2. WHEN I request performance report THEN the system SHALL show signal accuracy and timing statistics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN I analyze performance THEN the system SHALL provide signal distribution and success rates
5. WHEN I export logs THEN the system SHALL create detailed CSV reports for analysis
